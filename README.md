SQLAPI Python project description:

Project topic: Chinook database access API and data retrieval script

1 - Description:
The aim of the project is to create an API to access an SQLite database and to write a script to retrieve data using FastAPI. The database used for this project is the Chinook database, available at https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/.

2 - Key features :

2.1 - Data access API: 
The project will implement an API to access the data stored in the Chinook database. The API will provide access points for extracting information on artists, albums and music tracks.

2.2 - Data retrieval script : 
In addition to the API, an interactive script will be developed to allow the user to retrieve specific information from the database. 

2.3 - The script will ask the user to provide :

An artist name, and it will display artists including the given name.
An artist ID, and it will display the album names corresponding to this artist.
An album ID, and it will display the track names corresponding to that album.

2.4 - Using Git : 
The project's source files will be hosted on a Git repository, and the source code will be accessible via a link to the Git repository. This approach will enable code versioning and facilitate collaboration and project management.

3 - Objectives :

Implement an API to access a SQLite database.
Create an end-user-friendly interactive script.
Make it easy to find information on artists, albums and tracks in the Chinook database.
Use a Git repository to manage the project's source code.
The project aims to offer a user-friendly solution for exploring and retrieving data from the Chinook database, while providing well-organized and maintainable source code. The API and script will provide a fluid and efficient user experience for interacting with the music data stored in the database.
